# Notey

Notey is an AR application for Android, developed in Unity. It enables the user to create and attach virtual notes to real objects. 
By clicking on a "+" button user can create a new note. Clicking on a note itself enables user to edit the text in the note.

The AR experience in Notey was developed using Vuforia tool.

Current issues:
- User defined targets are deleted on application exit, as there are problems with adding them to the device database.
- Delete option
